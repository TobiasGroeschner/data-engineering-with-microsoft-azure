### Project Motivation

We are pretending to be a startup who wants to analyze user activity on a streaming app. The analysis is particularly focused on what songs are being listened to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate results since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

The goal is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions.


### File Descriptions

- `event_data/data_sample.png`: screenshot of raw data provided by udacity


### How to interact with this project

- not possible as this project was done in the udacity workspace

### Results

- see `Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb`

### Summary

- created three tables:
1. `sessions`
2. `users`
3. `songs`

Inserted data into tables. Executed queries to test if requirements are satisfied. Defined the *partition keys* and *clustering columns*.
